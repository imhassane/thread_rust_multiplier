# thread_rust_multiplier
This the Rust version of my university's project
https://github.com/imhassane/thread_c_multiplier/.

# What's the main goal.
The goal was to use threads, mutex and learn how to manage states within C applications.
As I am learning Rust, I adopted my C code to the Rust version.
